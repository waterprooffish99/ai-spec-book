As the number of tools and the complexity of tasks grow, the agent\'s central prompt (its \\"Spec\\") becomes bloated and confused. The agent can struggle to decide which tool to use, and its reasoning process can become inefficient.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"the-spec-driven-ai-engineer/chapter-5-deployment-and-feedback":{"id":"the-spec-driven-ai-engineer/chapter-5-deployment-and-feedback","title":"Chapter 5: Deployment & The Feedback Loop","description":"An AI agent running on your laptop is a prototype.
